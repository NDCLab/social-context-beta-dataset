## Project Goal

Broadly, this study aims to clarify relations between particular cognitive abilities, personality and social factors, and mental health outcomes. The specific objectives of the current study are as follows:
1. Determine whether relations between social anxiety and executive functions depend on social context or an individual’s temperament
2. Develop a novel task assessing inhibitory control with bivalent stimuli, and its application with the prior objective
3. Explore more how individual differences in cognitive abilities, personality, or social factors relate to mental health outcomes more generally
4. Inform future derivatives of this study concerned with different aspects of executive function (e.g task switching, inhibitory control, and working memory)

## Background & Design

Prior work suggests that individuals with a temperament known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also exhibit particular profiles of cognitive control ability, including impaired task switching or superior inhibitory control [(White et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624966/); [Buzzell et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280035/)). However, it remains unclear how much these associations depend on the context in which task switching and inhibitory control are assessed (i.e. within social settings as opposed to while alone). Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, other personality or social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is at least some work to suggest that the link between some forms of cognitive control (e.g. error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by whether cognitive control is assessed within a social context or not [(Buzzell et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29173744/). However, there is little work investigating the effect of social context on relations between social anxiety, task switching, and inhibitory control. Moreover, task switching and inhibitory control are related to the ability to maintain and manipulate information within short-term memory, a process referred to as “working memory”, but the link between working memory, social anxiety and temperament is unknown. The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a more broad investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes. 

In the study, participants sign up for a synchronous timeslot that will take place in Zoom. During administration of the study, the participant provides consent and completes a battery of questionnaires assessing different aspects of cognitive abilities, personality, and social factors, as well as behavioral tasks. The first behavioral task is a standard Eriksen Arrow Flanker, commonly used in accessing inhibitory control. The Multi-EF Inhibition task administered in the second half of the study is a modification of the existing inhibitory control paradigm, however with the addition of consistent bivalent stimuli differing in color (orange or blue) and shape (square or diamond). Participants will randomly receive one version of said task, responding to only the shape or the color. The standard Eriksen Arrow Flanker is completed once while alone, while the Multi-EF Inhibition task is completed twice, once while being watched and once while being disconnected from Zoom. Questionnaires are administered after each task, assessing their current state.
